# Naming conventions

camelCase   - classes, functions and variables
snake_case  - files and folders
kabob-case  - more seen in Python, more prominent in web-development [checks urls or websites], html syntax etc.

# Project 1:
1) bottom sheet
2) documentation -> widget catalog https://docs.flutter.dev
3) buttons and so on find out yourself

Use this for finding all flutter widgets: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/widgets-library.html

# Layout:
1) Row
2) Column
3) Grid
4) List View

# Errors:
1) Overflow errors: common and showed by (yellow+black) lines. This happens when something is beyond its limits. 
            To fix it
            a) either child elements need to be trimmed down or parent elements need to be expanded
            b) SingleChildScrollView - allow the screen to be scrollable i.e. it gives infinite vertical spacing
2) Unbounded Layout errors: recognised by screen looking all blanked, "size/height/width is infinite"
            To fix it
            a) define a size for the parent widget -->  Size size = MediaQuery.of(context).size 
                                                        size.width = 0.8 // that is 80% of the width
            [media query is a class that gives the information about the screen size of the phone]
            b) use constraints - unbounded constraints https://embrace.io/blog/constraints-in-flutter/
3) Type errors: data types are wrong 
            To fix it
            a) my making the value as the data type required
            b) or force the data type to be non-nullable by using the '!' sign or by setting default values by using '??' symbols
4) Design mismatch or Incorrect design: UI does not match the design [P.S.: you are a bad developer]
            To fix it
            a) be able to translate the design to implementation
            b) write clean, maintainable code
            c) refactor code
5) Copyright issues: legal issues
            To fix it
            a) talk to designer
            b) pay for the art/license
            c) free art unsplash.com
